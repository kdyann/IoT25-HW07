# IoT25-HW07
This project implements a BLE-based distance estimation system using two ESP32 boards.
The client scans for BLE signals from the server and reads the RSSI value.
A path-loss model is applied to estimate the distance from the RSSI.
The estimated distance is displayed in real time through a simple web server.
This system demonstrates basic BLE communication, distance estimation, and web visualization.
